# ICPNA-FP-INTERMEDIATE7

I am going to present the things that I use the most daily, I select 9 with a representative image of each one

I use my computer for most of the day to study and write code.

I use my cell phone to communicate with people and also relax

Well, the water to hydrate my body and cleaning in general

I basically use the toothbrush before every meal and also before I go to sleep

Well, sleep is an essential part of life, so every night I sleep in my bed

The towel is part of personal care, I always use it after a shower

I use this to eat my food throughout the day, morning, afternoon and night

I use it in my house all the time, I got used to using it since I was a child

and clothing, which is different depending on the weather
